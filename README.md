##The Effect of Airbnb's Market Entry on Hotels in Berlin: A Regression Discontinuity Approach.

###Project Background

This repository contains the material for the Third Pair Assignment in Introduction to Collaborative Social Science Data Analysis (MPP-E1180) @HSoG Berlin. Here, we gather, clean, and merge all of the relevant data for our final project. We also illustrate the data with descriptive statistics and a basic inferential model. In our paper, we will seek to illustrate the magnitude of the "Airbnb effect" on hotels in Berlin, using a Regression Discontinuity Model (RDM).
